# MangaFlow

## Overview
MangaFlow is an image manipulation tool specifically designed for manga (comic) files. It addresses common issues with digital manga formats that don't perfectly meet reader needs.

## Problems MangaFlow Solves

Many digital manga files available online present several challenges:

1. **Split Page Issues**: Adjacent pages that should be viewed together are often separated.
2. **Inconvenient Layouts**: Two-page spreads in formats that aren't optimized for mobile reading.
3. **Difficult Format Conversion**: Manga in formats like EPUB or PDF can be challenging to modify.

These issues often require multiple software applications and repetitive operations to fix. MangaFlow aims to provide a streamlined solution for all these manga handling problems in one lightweight application.

## Key Features

MangaFlow eliminates the need to open resource-intensive software just to perform simple operations like page separation. It offers an intuitive workflow designed specifically for manga editing.

## Development Status

This project is currently in the development stage. Several core features are still being implemented:

- [ ] Page separation tools
- [ ] Undo/redo operations
- [ ] Book-as-project editing functionality
- [ ] Multiple selection support for batch operations

Stay tuned for updates as development progresses!
